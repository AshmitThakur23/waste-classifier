# Number of classes
nc: 4

# Class names (will be mapped in post-processing)
# 0: general waste -> HAZARDOUS (safety default)
# 1: hazardous waste -> HAZARDOUS
# 2: organic -> ORGANIC (BIODEGRADABLE)
# 3: recyclable -> RECYCLABLE
names: ['general waste', 'hazardous waste', 'organic', 'recyclable']

# Class mapping for our app:
# organic -> GREEN dustbin (ORGANIC/BIODEGRADABLE)
# recyclable -> BLUE dustbin (RECYCLABLE)
# hazardous waste, general waste -> RED dustbin (HAZARDOUS)
